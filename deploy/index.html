                            <p>Geologically speaking, Niagara Falls is quite young. Some 12,000 years ago, the water plunged over the edge of the Niagara Escarpment--a steep slope that runs east/west from New York through Ontario, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois. Since the escarpment is most famous as the cliff over which the Niagara River drops off at Niagara Falls, it was named the Niagara Escarpment.</p>

                                <p>Native Americans living in the Niagara region were most likely the first people to behold the power of Niagara Falls. The first European to document the area was a French priest, Father Louis Hennepin. During a 1678 expedition, he was overwhelmed by the size and significance of Niagara Falls. When he returned to France, Hennepin published an account of his travels in "A New Discovery." The book brought Niagara Falls to the attention of the western world for the first time and inspired further exploration of the region.

                                <p>The potential power of Niagara Falls attracted industrialists who worked to harness its force using water wheels to drive their mills and factories. The world’s first large-scale hydroelectric generating station opened in Niagara Falls in 1895. The plant used the direct current (DC) system, however, which could only transmit electricity 100 yards.</p>

                                            The State Park does not have an actual physical address, therefore, this will bring you to the cross streets of 1st Street and Buffalo Avenue - which is the intersection at the entrance to the park and the base of the bridge to Goat Island.

                                                NOTE: While there are four parking lots in the State Park, they tend to fill up early on weekends (including Friday) and holidays which results in severe traffic entering the park from the Niagara Scenic Parkway and in some cases, all the way onto Grand Island (I-190). In order to avoid that, you might consider using alternate means into the city. Rt. 62/Niagara Falls Blvd. either from the I-290 or the I-190 if you choose to stay on this road, is a perfect way to enter the downtown core while avoiding traffic backups. This route will take you on city streets and add a few minutes to your trip but could save a great deal of time stuck in traffic. Once in the downtown core, you way park in a number of city lots that are just moments from the park. Additionally, you may consider using an alternate GPS address of 10 Rainbow Blvd., Niagara Falls, NY 14303 to take you to the official Niagara USA Welcome Center and alternate parking options.
